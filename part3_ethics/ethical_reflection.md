# Part 3: Ethical Reflection

## Scenario: Deploying Predictive Model for Resource Allocation

Your predictive model from Task 3 has been deployed in a software company to automatically prioritize bug fixes and allocate developer resources. The model analyzes issue complexity, historical data, and team capacity to assign priorities (high/medium/low) and route tasks to specific developers.

---

## 1. Potential Biases in the Dataset

### A. Historical Bias (Underrepresented Teams)

**The Problem:**
Training data reflects past decisions made by humans, who may have had unconscious biases. If historical data shows that issues from certain teams were consistently deprioritized, the AI will learn and perpetuate this pattern.

**Example Scenario:**
- **Frontend team issues** historically labeled "medium priority" 
- **Backend team issues** historically labeled "high priority"
- **Cause:** Backend team had more senior representation in priority meetings
- **AI Impact:** Model learns "backend issues are always more important"

**Real-World Consequences:**
```
Issue #2847: Critical UI bug affecting 50,000 users
- Reported by: Frontend team
- AI Prediction: Medium Priority (based on historical team bias)
- Actual Impact: Major user experience issue
- Result: Delayed fix, customer churn, revenue loss
```

**Data Evidence:**
- Frontend issues: 65% marked medium/low priority (historical avg)
- Backend issues: 78% marked high priority
- Yet customer impact analysis shows equal distribution of critical bugs

---

### B. Temporal Bias (Outdated Patterns)

**The Problem:**
Historical data includes outdated development practices, technologies, and team structures that no longer reflect current reality.

**Example Scenario:**
- Training data from 2020-2023 when company used monolithic architecture
- Certain types of database issues were always high priority
- Company migrated to microservices in 2024
- Same database issues now affect only one service, not entire system
- **AI Impact:** Overprioritizes legacy issue types

**Consequences:**
- Allocates 3 senior developers to minor database issue (overkill)
- Meanwhile, critical microservice communication bug gets low priority
- Resource misallocation leads to missed deadlines

---

### C. Reporting Bias (Who Reports Matters More)

**The Problem:**
Issues reported by senior developers, managers, or specific departments may have been historically prioritized faster.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Issues reported by:
- Senior developers: 90% marked high priority
- Junior developers: 45% marked high priority
- QA team: 60% marked high priority
- Customer support: 30% marked high priority
```

**AI Learning:**
"Priority depends more on WHO reported it than WHAT the issue is"

**Real-World Impact:**
```
Issue A: Memory leak causing 5% performance degradation
- Reported by: Senior architect
- AI Prediction: HIGH priority
- Resources allocated: 2 senior devs, 1 week

Issue B: Complete login failure for mobile users
- Reported by: Junior QA engineer
- AI Prediction: MEDIUM priority
- Resources allocated: 1 junior dev, after sprint
- Result: 10,000 users can't access app for 2 weeks
```

---

### D. Demographic Bias (Team Composition)

**The Problem:**
If historical data reflects a non-diverse development team, the model may not generalize well to diverse teams.

**Example Scenario:**
- Training data from 2020-2022: 85% male, 95% same geographic location
- Model learned patterns from this homogeneous group
- Company increased diversity in 2023-2024
- **Issue:** Model doesn't recognize work patterns of new diverse team members

**Specific Biases:**
1. **Timezone Bias:** Issues reported during US business hours prioritized higher
2. **Language Bias:** Issues with perfect English descriptions prioritized higher
3. **Communication Style Bias:** Direct, assertive issue descriptions prioritized over detailed, collaborative ones

**Impact:**
- Remote developers in Asia/Europe: Issues deprioritized
- Non-native English speakers: Bugs marked as "unclear," sent back for clarification
- Different communication styles: Collaborative approaches seen as "uncertain"

---

### E. Feature Selection Bias

**The Problem:**
The features used to train the model may encode proxy variables for protected characteristics.

**Example:**
```python
Features used:
- issue_complexity_score
- reporter_tenure (years at company)  # Proxy for age
- team_budget                          # Proxy for department status
- issue_description_length             # Proxy for English proficiency
- reporter_response_time               # Proxy for timezone/work hours
```

**How Bias Propagates:**
- `reporter_tenure` correlates with age → Age discrimination
- `team_budget` correlates with department → Favoritism toward revenue-generating teams
- `issue_description_length` correlates with English proficiency → Language discrimination
- `reporter_response_time` correlates with timezone → Geographic bias

---

### F. Feedback Loop Bias (Self-Reinforcing)

**The Problem:**
Once deployed, the model creates its own training data, amplifying existing biases.

**The Vicious Cycle:**
```
1. AI predicts Issue X is low priority (based on biased training)
2. Issue X gets assigned to junior dev with limited time
3. Issue X takes longer to resolve (poor resource allocation)
4. Historical data records: "Issues like X take long time, not urgent"
5. AI learns: "Issues like X are indeed low priority"
6. Future issues like X get even lower priority
7. Cycle continues, bias amplifies
```

**Example:**
- Mobile UI bugs historically assigned low priority
- Always given to interns/juniors (learning opportunity)
- Take 2-3x longer to fix (due to inexperience)
- **AI learns:** "Mobile UI bugs are low impact and time-consuming"
- **Reality:** Mobile UI bugs affect 60% of user base
- **Result:** Model systematically deprioritizes mobile issues

---

## 2. How Fairness Tools Could Address These Biases

### A. IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) - Comprehensive Solution

**What is AIF360?**
Open-source toolkit with 70+ fairness metrics and 10 bias mitigation algorithms for detecting and reducing bias in machine learning models.

---

#### **Step 1: Bias Detection with Fairness Metrics**

**1.1 Disparate Impact Analysis**

```python
from aif360.datasets import BinaryLabelDataset
from aif360.metrics import BinaryLabelDatasetMetric

# Define protected attributes
protected_attributes = ['team', 'reporter_seniority', 'timezone']

# Calculate disparate impact
dataset_metric = BinaryLabelDatasetMetric(
    dataset,
    unprivileged_groups=[{'team': 'frontend'}],
    privileged_groups=[{'team': 'backend'}]
)

disparate_impact = dataset_metric.disparate_impact()
print(f"Disparate Impact: {disparate_impact}")
# Ideal value: 1.0 (perfect fairness)
# Acceptable range: 0.8 - 1.2
# <0.8: Significant bias against unprivileged group
```

**Interpretation:**
```
Disparate Impact: 0.65
Translation: Frontend team issues are 35% less likely to be 
            marked high priority compared to backend issues
Action Required: YES - Below 0.8 threshold
```

**1.2 Statistical Parity Difference**

```python
stat_parity = dataset_metric.statistical_parity_difference()
print(f"Statistical Parity Difference: {stat_parity}")
# Ideal: 0.0
# Acceptable: -0.1 to +0.1
```

**Example Output:**
```
Statistical Parity by Team:
- Backend: 78% high priority
- Frontend: 45% high priority
- Difference: 33 percentage points (UNACCEPTABLE)

Statistical Parity by Reporter:
- Senior devs: 90% high priority
- Junior devs: 42% high priority
- Difference: 48 percentage points (CRITICAL BIAS)
```

---

#### **Step 2: Pre-Processing Bias Mitigation**

**2.1 Reweighing Algorithm**

```python
from aif360.algorithms.preprocessing import Reweighing

# Reweight training samples to achieve fairness
reweigher = Reweighing(
    unprivileged_groups=[{'team': 'frontend'}],
    privileged_groups=[{'team': 'backend'}]
)

# Transform dataset
dataset_transformed = reweigher.fit_transform(dataset)

# Now train model on reweighted data
model.fit(dataset_transformed.features, dataset_transformed.labels)
```

**How It Works:**
- Assigns higher weights to underrepresented cases
- Frontend high-priority issues: Weight = 1.5
- Backend high-priority issues: Weight = 1.0
- Balances influence during training

**Impact:**
- Before: 65% frontend issues correctly prioritized
- After: 88% frontend issues correctly prioritized
- Backend accuracy maintained at 90%

**2.2 Disparate Impact Remover**

```python
from aif360.algorithms.preprocessing import DisparateImpactRemover

# Remove bias from features while preserving predictive power
di_remover = DisparateImpactRemover(repair_level=1.0)
dataset_repaired = di_remover.fit_transform(dataset)

# Train model on repaired data
```

**How It Works:**
- Edits feature values to remove correlation with protected attributes
- Repair level 1.0 = maximum fairness (may reduce accuracy)
- Repair level 0.5 = balanced fairness/accuracy tradeoff

**Example:**
```
Original feature: issue_description_length
- Correlated with English proficiency
- After repair: Normalized to remove language bias
- Predictive power retained for actual complexity
```

---

#### **Step 3: In-Processing Bias Mitigation**

**3.1 Prejudice Remover**

```python
from aif360.algorithms.inprocessing import PrejudiceRemover

# Train model with fairness constraints
pr_model = PrejudiceRemover(
    sensitive_attr='team',
    eta=1.0  # Fairness penalty weight
)

pr_model.fit(X_train, y_train, sensitive_features=sensitive_train)
predictions = pr_model.predict(X_test)
```

**How It Works:**
- Adds fairness penalty to loss function
- Model optimizes for both accuracy AND fairness
- Higher eta = prioritize fairness more

**Results:**
```
Standard Model:
- Overall accuracy: 92%
- Backend accuracy: 95%
- Frontend accuracy: 78%
- Fairness gap: 17%

Prejudice Remover (eta=1.0):
- Overall accuracy: 89%
- Backend accuracy: 90%
- Frontend accuracy: 87%
- Fairness gap: 3% ✓
```

**Tradeoff:** 3% accuracy drop for 14% fairness improvement

---

#### **Step 4: Post-Processing Bias Mitigation**

**4.1 Equalized Odds Post-Processing**

```python
from aif360.algorithms.postprocessing import EqOddsPostprocessing

# Adjust predictions to achieve equalized odds
eqodds = EqOddsPostprocessing(
    unprivileged_groups=[{'team': 'frontend'}],
    privileged_groups=[{'team': 'backend'}]
)

# Fit on validation set
eqodds.fit(val_dataset, model_predictions)

# Transform test predictions
fair_predictions = eqodds.predict(test_dataset)
```

**How It Works:**
- Adjusts prediction thresholds for different groups
- Frontend threshold: 0.45 (more lenient)
- Backend threshold: 0.55 (more strict)
- Equalizes true positive and false positive rates

**Impact:**
```
Before Post-Processing:
- Frontend TPR (True Positive Rate): 72%
- Backend TPR: 93%
- Fairness violation: 21%

After Post-Processing:
- Frontend TPR: 88%
- Backend TPR: 89%
- Fairness violation: 1% ✓
```

**4.2 Calibrated Equalized Odds**

```python
from aif360.algorithms.postprocessing import CalibratedEqOddsPostprocessing

# More sophisticated threshold optimization
cal_eqodds = CalibratedEqOddsPostprocessing(
    unprivileged_groups=[{'team': 'frontend'}],
    privileged_groups=[{'team': 'backend'}],
    cost_constraint='fpr'  # Minimize false positive rate
)

fair_predictions = cal_eqodds.fit_predict(val_dataset, test_dataset, model)
```

---

### B. Fairlearn (Microsoft) - Alternative Approach

**Fairlearn Advantages:**
- User-friendly Python API
- Integrates with scikit-learn
- Interactive dashboard for exploring fairness

**Implementation:**

```python
from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame, selection_rate
from fairlearn.reductions import ExponentiatedGradient, DemographicParity

# 1. Measure fairness across groups
metric_frame = MetricFrame(
    metrics={'accuracy': accuracy_score, 'selection_rate': selection_rate},
    y_true=y_test,
    y_pred=y_pred,
    sensitive_features=team_test
)

print(metric_frame.by_group)
# Shows accuracy and selection rate for each team

# 2. Train fair model
constraint = DemographicParity()
mitigator = ExponentiatedGradient(base_estimator, constraint)
mitigator.fit(X_train, y_train, sensitive_features=team_train)

# 3. Get fair predictions
fair_predictions = mitigator.predict(X_test)
```

**Dashboard Visualization:**
```python
from fairlearn.widget import FairlearnDashboard

FairlearnDashboard(
    sensitive_features=team_test,
    y_true=y_test,
    y_pred={'Original': y_pred, 'Mitigated': fair_predictions}
)
# Opens interactive web interface showing fairness metrics
```

### C. Comprehensive Bias Mitigation Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Detection (Week 1-2)**

**Actions:**
1. **Data Audit:**
   ```python
   # Analyze historical priority distributions
   priority_by_team = df.groupby('team')['priority'].value_counts(normalize=True)
   priority_by_seniority = df.groupby('reporter_level')['priority'].value_counts(normalize=True)
   
   # Check for significant disparities
   if max(priority_by_team) - min(priority_by_team) > 0.15:
       print("WARNING: >15% disparity across teams")
   ```

2. **Feature Correlation Analysis:**
   ```python
   # Identify proxy variables
   correlations = df.corr()['priority'].sort_values(ascending=False)
   
   # Flag problematic features
   if correlations['reporter_tenure'] > 0.3:
       print("WARNING: Tenure strongly correlates with priority")
   ```

3. **Run Fairness Metrics:**
   ```python
   # Calculate all AIF360 metrics
   metrics = [
       'disparate_impact',
       'statistical_parity_difference', 
       'equal_opportunity_difference',
       'average_odds_difference'
   ]
   
   for metric in metrics:
       score = calculate_metric(metric, dataset)
       print(f"{metric}: {score}")
   ```

**Deliverables:**
- Bias report documenting all detected disparities
- Feature importance analysis
- Recommendations for mitigation approach

---

#### **Phase 2: Mitigation (Week 3-4)**

**Strategy: Layered Approach**

**Layer 1: Data Collection Improvements**
```python
# Implement better data collection going forward
def create_issue(title, description, reporter):
    issue = {
        'title': title,
        'description': description,
        'reporter_id': reporter.id,
        # REMOVE: reporter_tenure, team_budget (proxy variables)
        # ADD: Objective metrics only
        'affected_users_count': count_affected_users(),
        'severity_score': calculate_technical_severity(),
        'business_impact_score': estimate_revenue_impact(),
        'security_risk': assess_security_risk()
    }
    return issue
```

**Layer 2: Apply Pre-Processing**
```python
# Reweigh historical data
reweigher = Reweighing(
    unprivileged_groups=[{'team': 'frontend'}, {'seniority': 'junior'}],
    privileged_groups=[{'team': 'backend'}, {'seniority': 'senior'}]
)
fair_dataset = reweigher.fit_transform(dataset)
```

**Layer 3: Train Fair Model**
```python
# Use fairness-constrained learning
from fairlearn.reductions import EqualizedOdds

constraint = EqualizedOdds()
fair_model = ExponentiatedGradient(
    RandomForestClassifier(),
    constraint,
    eps=0.01  # Fairness tolerance
)

fair_model.fit(
    X_train, 
    y_train, 
    sensitive_features=pd.DataFrame({
        'team': team_train,
        'seniority': seniority_train
    })
)
```

**Layer 4: Post-Processing Calibration**
```python
# Final fairness adjustment
postprocessor = EqOddsPostprocessing(
    unprivileged_groups=[{'team': 'frontend'}],
    privileged_groups=[{'team': 'backend'}]
)

final_predictions = postprocessor.fit_predict(
    val_dataset,
    test_dataset, 
    fair_model
)
```

---

#### **Phase 3: Monitoring (Ongoing)**

**Continuous Fairness Monitoring:**

```python
class FairnessMonitor:
    def __init__(self, model, protected_attributes):
        self.model = model
        self.protected_attributes = protected_attributes
        self.metrics_history = []
    
    def evaluate_batch(self, X, y, sensitive_features):
        """Evaluate fairness on each prediction batch."""
        predictions = self.model.predict(X)
        
        # Calculate fairness metrics
        metrics = {
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'disparate_impact': calculate_disparate_impact(
                y, predictions, sensitive_features
            ),
            'demographic_parity': calculate_demographic_parity(
                predictions, sensitive_features
            ),
            'equalized_odds': calculate_equalized_odds(
                y, predictions, sensitive_features
            )
        }
        
        self.metrics_history.append(metrics)
        
        # Alert if fairness degrades
        if metrics['disparate_impact'] < 0.8:
            self.alert_team("Disparate impact below threshold!")
        
        return metrics
    
    def generate_report(self):
        """Weekly fairness report."""
        return pd.DataFrame(self.metrics_history)

# Deploy monitor
monitor = FairnessMonitor(model, ['team', 'seniority', 'timezone'])

# Evaluate every batch
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_priority():
    issue_data = request.json
    X = preprocess(issue_data)
    
    # Make prediction
    priority = model.predict(X)
    
    # Monitor fairness
    monitor.evaluate_batch(X, y_true, sensitive_features)
    
    return {'priority': priority}
```

**Weekly Fairness Dashboard:**
```python
def generate_weekly_dashboard():
    df = monitor.generate_report()
    
    # Visualize fairness trends
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
    
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
    plt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['disparate_impact'])
    plt.axhline(y=0.8, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Threshold')
    plt.title('Disparate Impact Over Time')
    
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
    plt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['demographic_parity'])
    plt.axhline(y=0, color='green', linestyle='--')
    plt.title('Demographic Parity Over Time')
    
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
    plt.plot(df['timestamp'], df['equalized_odds'])
    plt.title('Equalized Odds Over Time')
    
    plt.savefig('weekly_fairness_report.png')
```
